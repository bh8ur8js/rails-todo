Rails Todo App Using Turbo Streams

This application has a crude form of WebAuthn as testing

To run this project:
```
git clone https://github.com/tywil04/rails-todo.git
cd rails-todo
bundle # Installs required gems
rails db:migrate # Creates the required tables in the database
bin/dev # Runs the development server on localhost:3000
```
